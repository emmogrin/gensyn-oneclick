# üß† SAINT KHEN's Gensyn One-Click Node Setup

Simple one-click scripts to run [Gensyn's](https://gensyn.ai) RL-Swarm nodes via Docker ‚Äî with full support for both **CPU-only** and **GPU** machines.

## üöÄ What's Inside?

- ‚úÖ `gensyn-cpu.sh` ‚Äî For CPU-only systems (VPS, laptops, WSL)
- ‚ö° `gensyn-gpu.sh` ‚Äî For NVIDIA CUDA-enabled machines

These scripts will:
- Install all dependencies
- Clone the RL-Swarm repo
- Build & run the Docker container
- Back up your Gensyn identity (`swarm.pem`)
- Optional LocalTunnel exposure for VPS users

## üì¶ Requirements

- **Ubuntu 22.04+**
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **Internet connection**
- **GPU machine (for GPU version only)**
- Create account on ( `https://dashboard.gensyn.ai/` )
- Create huggingface account ( `https://huggingface.co/` )

## üîß How to use

# Step 1: Clone the repo && Run the Script

üß† CPU-Only Systems
```
git clone https://github.com/emmogrin/gensyn-oneclick.git
cd gensyn-oneclick
chmod +x gensyn-cpu.sh
./gensyn-cpu.sh
```

üöÄ GPU-Enabled Systems
```
git clone https://github.com/emmogrin/gensyn-oneclick.git
cd gensyn-oneclick
chmod +x gensyn-gpu.sh
./gensyn-gpu.sh
```

üåê Accessing the Node Dashboard

üë®‚Äçüíª Local Users (PC, WSL, etc.)

Visit:
```
http://localhost:3000
```
üõ∞Ô∏è VPS Users

Run this in a separate terminal:
```
npx localtunnel --port 3000
```
This gives you a public URL like:
https://loose-cats-tickle.loca.lt

Paste that link in your browser to complete sign-in.
(your vps ip is your Tunnel password)
---
---
# After login, your terminal starts installation.

Answer prompts:

Would you like to upload your trained models to Hugging Face Hub? (y/N)
üëâ Press N to continue on the testnet without uploading.

> Uploading requires at least 2GB upload bandwidth ‚Äî recommended if you're on a VPS.
Press Y to enable uploads, then paste your Hugging Face access token when prompted.
> 
Now choose the model you want to use.
If you're not using a GPU, it's best to stick with the default model for smoother performance.
Press Enter to use the default.
If you are using a GPU, you can try one of the more powerful models below (‚ö†Ô∏è models marked with B need more vRAM):

Gensyn/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct
Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
nvidia/AceInstruct-1.5B
dnotitia/Smoothie-Qwen3-1.7B
Gensyn/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct

# Incase of reboot or restart of Pc.
```
cd ~/gensyn-oneclick/rl-swarm
sudo docker compose run --rm --build swarm-cpu
```

üîê How swarm.pem is Saved & Reused

Once you log in, Gensyn generates your identity file:
```
/app/rl-swarm/swarm.pem
```

‚úÖ This script automatically backs it up to:
```
/backup/app/rl-swarm/swarm.pem
```
You can reuse this file on another machine or container by copying it back into the same path before running the node again.

To copy it out of Docker:
```
docker ps
```
```
docker cp <container_id>:/app/rl-swarm/swarm.pem .
```
To reuse it later, mount it in Docker or place it manually in the same directory.

üìÑ How to Check Logs

Inside the container, logs are stored at:
```
tail -f /app/rl-swarm/logs/latest.log
```
To check logs:

docker ps            # get container ID or name
docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> bash
cat /app/rl-swarm/logs/latest.log

You‚Äôll see detailed events like:

Model loading

Network peer connections

Training rounds

Errors (if any)

üßº Cleanup Tips

üßπ How to Delete Gensyn Files Only
To remove everything related to Gensyn (containers, repo folder, backups):
# 1. Stop any running containers (optional but safe)
```
docker ps
```
check for the container id and replace
```
docker stop <container_id>
```
# 2. Remove the RL Swarm repo and backup
```
rm -rf ~/gensyn-oneclick/rl-swarm
rm -rf ~/gensyn-oneclick/backup
```
This would remove everything in docker(not advice able)
To remove all Docker containers, images, and cache:
```
sudo docker container prune -f
sudo docker image prune -af
sudo docker volume prune -f
sudo docker builder prune -af
```
