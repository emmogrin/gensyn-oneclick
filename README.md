# 🧠 SAINT KHEN's Gensyn One-Click Node Setup

Simple one-click scripts to run [Gensyn's](https://gensyn.ai) RL-Swarm nodes via Docker — with full support for both **CPU-only** and **GPU** machines.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

- ✅ `gensyn-cpu.sh` — For CPU-only systems (VPS, laptops, WSL)
- ⚡ `gensyn-gpu.sh` — For NVIDIA CUDA-enabled machines

These scripts will:
- Install all dependencies
- Clone the RL-Swarm repo
- Build & run the Docker container
- Back up your Gensyn identity (`swarm.pem`)
- Optional LocalTunnel exposure for VPS users
  

---

## 📦 Requirements

- **Ubuntu 22.04+**
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **Internet connection**
- **GPU machine (for GPU version only)**
- Create account on ( `https://dashboard.gensyn.ai/` )
- Create huggingface account ( `https://huggingface.co/` )

## CPU&GPU Support 
You can train on either CPU or GPU, depending on your setup:

🔸 CPU-Only Setup (Advanced)
Architecture: ARM64 or x86
Minimum: 32GB RAM

⚠️ Note: Running other apps during training may lead to crashes or instability.

🔹 GPU Setup (Recommended)
Supported GPUs:
RTX 3090
RTX 4090
RTX 5090
NVIDIA A100
NVIDIA H100

Recommended: GPUs with ≥24GB vRAM
✅ Gensyn also supports GPUs with less than 24GB vRAM
CUDA Driver: Version 12.6 or higher

## 🔧 How to use
---

# Step 1: Clone the repo && Run the Script

🧠 CPU-Only Systems
```
git clone https://github.com/emmogrin/gensyn-oneclick.git
cd gensyn-oneclick
chmod +x gensyn-cpu.sh
./gensyn-cpu.sh
```

🚀 GPU-Enabled Systems
```
git clone https://github.com/emmogrin/gensyn-oneclick.git
cd gensyn-oneclick
chmod +x gensyn-gpu.sh
./gensyn-gpu.sh
```
Or Use this [Manual Experimental Guide](https://github.com/emmogrin/gensyn-oneclick/blob/main/ManualREADME.md)

🌐 Accessing the Node Dashboard

👨‍💻 Local Users (PC, WSL, etc.)

Visit:
```
http://localhost:3000
```
🛰️ VPS Users

Run this in a separate terminal:
```
npx localtunnel --port 3000
```
This gives you a public URL like:
https://loose-cats-tickle.loca.lt

Paste that link in your browser to complete sign-in.
(your vps ip is your Tunnel password)
---
---
# After login, your terminal starts installation.

Answer prompts:

Would you like to upload your trained models to Hugging Face Hub? (y/N)

Note: 
Uploading requires at least 2GB upload bandwidth — recommended if you're on a VPS.
Press Y to enable uploads, then paste your Hugging Face access token when prompted.
> 
Now choose the model you want to use.
If you're not using a GPU, it's best to stick with the default model for smoother performance.
Press Enter to use the default.
If you are using a GPU, you can try one of the more powerful models below (⚠️ models marked with B need more vRAM):

Gensyn/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct
Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
nvidia/AceInstruct-1.5B
dnotitia/Smoothie-Qwen3-1.7B
Gensyn/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct

# Incase of reboot or restart of Pc.
```
cd ~/gensyn-oneclick/rl-swarm
sudo docker compose run --rm --build swarm-cpu
```

🔐 How swarm.pem is Saved & Reused

Once you log in, Gensyn generates your identity file:
```
/app/rl-swarm/swarm.pem
```

✅ This script automatically backs it up to:
```
/backup/app/rl-swarm/swarm.pem
```
You can reuse this file on another machine or container by copying it back into the same path before running the node again.

To copy it out of Docker:
```
docker ps
```
```
docker cp <container_id>:/app/rl-swarm/swarm.pem .
```
To reuse it later, mount it in Docker or place it manually in the same directory.


---

✅️ To update incase of a new release ✅️
```
cd ~/gensyn-oneclick/rl-swarm
git switch main
git reset --hard
git clean -fd
git pull origin main
```
📄 How to Check Logs

To check logs:
```
docker ps
```
Then Enter the container id you saw.
example: sudo docker logs 3f3b2eac7a2d

```
sudo docker logs <container_id you saw after entering docker ps>
```
You’ll see detailed events like:

Model loading

Network peer connections

Training rounds

Errors (if any)

🧼 Cleanup Tips

🧹 How to Delete Gensyn Files Only
To remove everything related to Gensyn (containers, repo folder, backups):
# 1. Stop any running containers (optional but safe)
```
docker ps
```
check for the container id and replace
```
docker stop <container_id>
```
# 2. Remove the RL Swarm repo and backup
```
rm -rf ~/gensyn-oneclick/rl-swarm
rm -rf ~/gensyn-oneclick/backup
```
This would remove everything in docker(not advice able)
To remove all Docker containers, images, and cache:
```
sudo docker container prune -f
sudo docker image prune -af
sudo docker volume prune -f
sudo docker builder prune -af
```
